# Audio Style Transfer

<p align="center"> <i>Audio Style Transfer</i> aims to create unique audio samples by combining a base audio file and style audio file. We do this by applying a computer vision known as "style transfer".</p>

# Style Tranfer

*Style tranfer* requires two different files: a content and a style. The style is extracted from the file and applied to the content. In this case, the content is the notes of the content file, while the style is how the style file is played, such as rhythm or instruments. The objective of the style transfer is to get the program to play the content audio file in the style extracted from the style audio file.

# Spectrogram

*A spectrogram* is a visual representation, or graph, of the frequencies of sound over a period of time. In this case, there are separate spectrograms for the two different audio files, content and style. There is also a final spectrogram showing the style transfer audio file. The lines in the spectrogram show the pitches, or notes. The background color on the spectrogram represents the amound of noise behind the sound.

# Tonnetz

*Tonnetz* is a diagram that shows tones in space without using frequency numbers. It was first introduced by Euler to show tonal space and tone relationships in terms of thirds or fifths. In this experiment, tonnetz are used to change the loss function of sound.

# Pitch Shift
Librosaâ€™s pitch shift takes the audio track inputted and lowers the pitches up or down based on the stated amount of half-steps. For example, a pitch shift of -6 would shift the audio 6 half-steps down and a pitch shift of 6 would shift the audio 6 half-steps up. Pitch shift was used to change the pitches of the style to decrease the amount of noise distortion in the content after the style transfer. The magnitude of the pitch shift was determined based on the song.
